## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Title: "Eco-Seeker: Empowering Eco-Friendly Disposal of E-Waste"

## Problem Statement:

Develop a user-friendly web application that enables individuals to locate the nearest e-waste collection and recycling centers based on their geographical location. The platform should provide educational resources highlighting the environmental and health impacts of improper e-waste disposal. Additionally, integrate a feature where users can input their old device models to track the amount of precious metals recovered and earn credits for responsible disposal practices. The goal is to encourage sustainable behavior and reduce the environmental footprint of electronic waste.

## Key Issues

Lack of Awareness: Many individuals are unaware of the harmful effects of improper e-waste disposal on the environment and human health.
Inadequate Recycling Infrastructure: There is a shortage of easily accessible e-waste collection and recycling facilities in many areas.
Disposal of Precious Materials: Valuable metals and components present in e-waste are often discarded improperly, leading to resource wastage.
Environmental Impact: E-waste, if not handled correctly, can release hazardous substances into the environment, polluting soil, water, and air.
Health Risks: Improper handling of e-waste can pose serious health risks to workers involved in recycling processes and communities living near disposal sites.
Lack of Incentives: There is a need for incentives or rewards for individuals to adopt responsible e-waste disposal practices and participate in recycling initiatives.

## Idea

One potential idea to address the key issues related to e-waste management is to create a comprehensive mobile application called "EcoRecycle." Here's an outline of the idea:

Concept: "EcoRecycle" is a user-friendly mobile app designed to promote responsible e-waste disposal, educate users about the environmental impact of e-waste, and facilitate easy access to nearby recycling facilities.

## Technology Stack

### Mobile App Development:
Platform: Cross-platform development using frameworks like React Native or Flutter can be beneficial as it allows you to build the app for both iOS and Android platforms simultaneously.
Programming Languages: JavaScript (for React Native) or Dart (for Flutter).
IDE: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or any preferred IDE for React Native or Flutter development.

### Backend Development:
Server-Side Language: Node.js with Express.js framework can be a good choice for building the backend APIs and server logic.
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data, device details, recycling center information, etc.
API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI for documenting and defining your backend APIs.

### Authentication and User Management:
Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization.
User Data Storage: Use a secure and scalable storage solution for user data, such as Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.

This technology stack provides a robust foundation for developing a feature-rich and scalable mobile application like "EcoRecycle" that promotes responsible e-waste disposal and engages users in environmental conservation efforts.

## Dependencies

React Native: A JavaScript framework for cross-platform mobile app development.
Express.js: A minimalist Node.js web framework for building backend APIs.
Firebase: For authentication, real-time database, and push notifications.
Google Maps API: For integrating maps and geolocation services in the app.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend server.
Redux (for React Native) or Provider (for Flutter): For state management and data flow control.
Mongoose (for MongoDB) or PostgreSQL Client (for PostgreSQL): For database operations and data modeling.
